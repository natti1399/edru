# Privacy Policy — EDRU

**Last updated: February 15, 2026**

## Overview

EDRU ("the App") is a sobriety tracking app designed for personal wellness. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect (almost none) and how we handle it.

## Data Collection

**EDRU does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

All data you enter in the App — including sobriety dates, party logs, streak history, and personal plans — is stored **locally on your device only**. This data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.

We do not collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Advertising identifiers
- Health data sent to external servers

## Data Storage

- All app data is stored locally on your device using encrypted storage (MMKV with AES-256)
- No data is sent to any server, cloud service, or third party
- No user account or registration is required to use the App

## Data Deletion

You can delete all your data at any time from within the App:
- Go to **Innstillinger** (Settings) > **Slett all data** (Delete all data)
- This permanently removes all locally stored data
- Uninstalling the App also removes all data

## Third-Party Services

EDRU does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

The App may use Apple's push notification service to deliver local reminders you have configured. Notification content never contains personal health information.

## Children's Privacy

EDRU is not directed at children under the age of 17. The App deals with alcohol-related content and is intended for adults.

## GDPR Compliance

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norway:
- **Legal basis**: The App processes data based on your consent and legitimate interest in personal wellness tracking
- **Data minimization**: We collect no personal data beyond what you voluntarily enter
- **Right to erasure**: You can delete all data at any time within the App
- **Data portability**: You can export your data from the App's settings
- **No data transfers**: No data leaves your device

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
